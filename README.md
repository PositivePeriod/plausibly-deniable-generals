# Plausibly Deniable Generals

This project is the intersection of github.com/ad510/plausible-deniability and generals.io/

The basic idea is to create a way for custom clients to "cheat" in a fair and controlled way in a game very similar to generals.io

The way it does this is by only having clients show the neccessary information for interacting with other players to tghe server and then upon finishing the game reveal the moves they played. Changing the moves they played midgame is totally acceptable, but there has to be a normal rule-following replay that matches the given midgame information.

## Why

I really liked the idea of plausible deniability, but feel that the key idea wasn't fully explored within the RTS genre (because it is hard to make a good system for powerful "cheating"). I feel that a discrete semi-realtime strategy game can be more fully explored and may be able to shed light for the RTS side (which if well designed could be amazing).

## Protocol

Because this is project really needs competeing clients to reach maximum potential, the protocal for interacting with the server is going to be fully documented, but I haven't finalized it yet.
